_description: Default settings

# Attaching files within messages has a customizable syntax which can be configured with a regular expression.  The
# default provided here uses doubled angle brackets. For example, `<<~/myfile>>`.  Modifying this regular expression can
# change the syntax. It is important for the syntax used to not risk colliding with input, which can be tricky for
# messages involving source code or templating. The syntax also should not have false matches. The regex must have one
# capture group to work properly.

# When enabled, attachments found in chat messages are automatically sent to the LLM.
# In cases where the syntax is creating false positives, this provides an easy way to turn it off.
chat.attachments_enabled: true
# The embedded syntax is used for retrieving sections from within an LLM generated response.  The regex can have
# multiple captures, but only the first capture with a non-empty response is used for each match. This default regex
# takes either the string found within <answer></answer> tags or a code block.
